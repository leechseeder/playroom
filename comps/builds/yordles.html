    <h1>Yordle Reroll</h1>
    <p>In order to run this you're ideally going to want the Unstable Yordle Delivery augment and/or a God Willow's Grove game start. Reroll or interest prismatics are obviously great but leave you fairly vulnerable to getting run over early by tempo augment users.</p>
    <p>God Willow's Grove is particularly helpful as it allows you to leave Tristana or Kled benched whilst achieving a 5 Yordle bonus.</p>
    <ol>
        <li> At the start of the game you'll need to move towards a board state with a stable enough frontline to mitigate loss significance.</li>

        <li> Once you have been able to slow roll a 3* Poppy on level 5, proceed to 6 and focus on Teemo. The board becomes a bit more flexible here, I find success running more Bastion units to support Poppy if I have been able to get a Blue Buff or damage item onto Teemo to ensure consistent DPS output.</li>

        <li> With Teemo complete you have hopefully been able to finish another 2-cost unit in the process, activating 4* mode. From here I seek to level pretty aggressively to level 8. With the amount of pressure you begin to exert on the lobby it's a good time to try pick up uncontested 4-cost units. There is a <b>LOT</b> of opportunity to flex the comp around here, so it's good so splash units they you think either have a 3* angle or create significant frustration for existing strong boards.</li>
